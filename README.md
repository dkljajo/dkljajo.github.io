# David Kljajo website
# 💻 Interactive DevOps Terminal Portfolio

### 🚀 Just Launched: [dkljajo.github.io](https://dkljajo.github.io)

Welcome to my **interactive DevOps portfolio — with a hacker-style twist!**  
Instead of a traditional static website, I built a **fully functional terminal interface** where you can type real commands to explore my projects, experience, and GitHub data.

---

## 🧠 Concept

I wanted to showcase my **DevOps expertise and creativity** in a single experience.  
DevOps isn’t just about automation and infrastructure — it’s about **innovative problem-solving** and **engineering experiences** that stand out.

So I built a site that looks and feels like a real terminal — but it’s actually a portfolio you can navigate by typing commands!

## 🧠 Inspiration

> “DevOps is about creativity as much as reliability.”  
This portfolio is a reflection of both — a space where technical precision meets design experimentation.
